This is a modified version of the hdf4 source
to simplify its build. It is derived from
hdf4 version 4.2.13.

It currently only supports autoconf builds.
After checking out from github, you should need to do
the following, assuming you have libjpeg in /usr/local/lib;
fix as needed. Change CFLAGS if you wish, and
enable/disable static and shared as desired.
	export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -lz -ljpeg"
	export CFLAGS="-g -O0"
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-static --enable-shared
